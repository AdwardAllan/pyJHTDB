  In theory setuptools should take care of everything so that the
package is installed properly, but I noticed that it doesn't.

What worked on ubuntu 14.04 (with internet access available):
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  sudo apt-get install gfortran
  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
  sudo easy_install numpy
  sudo python setup.py install

  I haven't tested the installation on any other system, but I think
very small variations on the above should work for the minimal
installation on all unix systems (i.e. for MacOS as well).
  If you manage to get it working (i.e. you import test_plain like the
README says and you can run it), please let me know what steps you
needed to take for your system, so I can append the instructions to
this file.
